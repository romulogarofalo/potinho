## Introduction
**Potinho** is a back-end to simulate a bank, responsible to create users and carry out transactions

## Technologies
What was used:
- **[Docker](https://docs.docker.com)** and **[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)** to create our development and test environments.
- **[github actions](https://github.com/features/actions)** for ~~deployment~~ and as general CI.
- **[Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)** to store the data and **[Ecto](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.html)** as a """ORM""" (but is not a ORM is a DSL).
- **[Ex_unit](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_unit/main/ExUnit.html)** to run tests.
- **[ASDF](https://asdf-vm.com/)** to manage multiple versions
- **[LiveBook]**() To easily create scripts of a business cycle

# Getting Started
To get started, you should install **Docker**, **Docker Compose**, and **ASDF**.
Then, clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/romulogarofalo/Gastar.me.git
```
enter in the folder
```sh
cd potinho
```

run asdf to install elixir and erlang
```sh
asdf install
```

if the commnad above not work maybe you could need to add the elixir and erlang to asdf work **[more info here](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-elixir)**
```sh
asdf plugin-add elixir https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-elixir.git
asdf plugin add erlang https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-erlang.git

```

You should run to download dependencies
```
mix deps.get
```
to install all the dependencies
## Running Locally
To run locally, simply run the following command:
```sh
docker-compose up
```
## Running Tests
To run the tests, run the following command:
```sh
mix test
```
## Running The Server
To run the tests, run the following command:
```sh
mix phx.server
```

## Running The Livebook
when docker-compose is up the Livebook will be up on [localhost:8080](localhost:8080) and to make the requests the server will need to be up on your computer (not the docker)
